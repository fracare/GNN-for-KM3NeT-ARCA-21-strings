# GNN-for-KM3NeT-ARCA-21-strings
This repository contains all the scripts needed to run a track and shower classification with GNN for the detector KM3NeT/ARCA. In order to do this, the installation of some packages is needed, namely Orcasong (https://ml.pages.km3net.de/OrcaSong/index.html) and Orcanet (https://ml.pages.km3net.de/OrcaNet/index.html). A report containing a code description and the results of the analysis is available at https://www.overleaf.com/read/tmgshcwzmjpm.
